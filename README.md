# business-loan

Hey, This is Vishal here and this exercise is to build a simple business loan application system. I have developed a basic front-end design and haven't used that much of stylesheets for the application.

1. I have developed a application using ReactJS and used Node.js for backend in order to get the balance sheet
2. Enter the folder directory in the terminal, use npm start
3. Once you give npm start, it will by default open on localhost:3000
4. After it gets opened, there will be a server.js file
5. See the directory of the server.js file, run node server.js on an another terminal
6. Now if you enter some sample input into the localhost:3000, you will get the desired output
